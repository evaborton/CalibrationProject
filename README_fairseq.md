# <a name="introduction"></a> BERTweet: A pre-trained language model for English Tweets

BERTweet is the first public large-scale language model pre-trained for English Tweets. BERTweet is trained based on the [RoBERTa](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/roberta/README.md)  pre-training procedure. The corpus used to pre-train BERTweet consists of 850M English Tweets (16B word tokens ~ 80GB), containing 845M Tweets streamed from 01/2012 to 08/2019 and 5M Tweets related to the **COVID-19** pandemic. The general architecture and experimental results of BERTweet can be found in our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-demos.2/):

```python

BERTweet = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('/Absolute-path-to/BERTweet_base_fairseq', checkpoint_file='model.pt', bpe='fastbpe', bpe_codes=bpe_codes_file).eval()

# INPUT TEXT IS TOKENIZED!

# Extract the last layer's features
subwords = BERTweet.encode(line)

# Extract all layer's features (layer 0 is the embedding layer)
all_layers = BERTweet.extract_features(subwords, return_all_hiddens=True)
assert len(all_layers) == 13
assert torch.all(all_layers[-1] == last_layer_features)

# Filling marks
masked_line = 'SC has first two presumptive cases of  <mask> , DHEC confirms HTTPURL via @USER :cry:'
